    "Pandas is a great tool and is used for a variety of purposes like data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, visual analysis, building features for ML models to name a few. We <3 pandas! However, we have seen that as soon as you hit scale, things start slowing down. People generally switch to Spark Data Frames. Porting pandas to spark DFs can be painful and might not be efficient until and unless you have super large datasets.\n",

    "One of our data engineering piece started off small (100s of thousand data points / day) but quickly became a largish data problem (5M rows / day). That is when we decided to try out dask. Our chunked pandas dataframe techniques used to take 20 hrs to perform complex data cleansing on 300k rows vs 2.5 million rows in 60 mins on dask!"

    "Dask provides a framework for performing parallel computing for analytics.\n",

    "Dask is composed of two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic task scheduling optimized for computation. This is similar to Airflow, Luigi, Celery, or Make, but optimized for interactive computational workloads.\n",
    "* “Big Data” collections like parallel arrays, dataframes, and lists that extend common interfaces like NumPy, Pandas, or Python iterators to larger-than-memory or distributed environments. These parallel collections run on top of the dynamic task schedulers."
